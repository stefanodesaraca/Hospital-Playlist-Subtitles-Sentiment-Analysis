1835.333,1837.543,Changing the lead surgeon isn't that simple.,5.0,614
1837.627,1839.747,Are you going to watch the patient die?,,615
1839.838,1840.668,Hey!,5.0,616
1842.966,1846.586,Professor Min said he won't do a craniotomy. He'll do the TSA.,5.0,617
1846.678,1847.718,What's the problem here?,5.0,618
1848.471,1852.021,He's only performed a TSA once in his career.,,619
1852.976,1854.476,And his fellow doctor,,620
1854.561,1856.901,did most of the work while he just stood in the OR.,,621
1857.522,1859.442,The tumor expanded into the suprasellar region.,,622
1859.524,1862.114,Executing the TSA will be especially difficult for this case.,,623
1862.193,1864.363,I'm sure he can handle it.,5.0,624
1864.988,1866.738,"At his previous hospital, his fellow doctor",,625
1866.823,1868.703,did the TSA for him. But what about us?,,626
1868.783,1871.043,We have you. You can assist him.,5.0,627
1871.119,1872.699,I don't know anything!,,628

1876.124,1877.134,Professor Chae.,,630
1877.625,1881.165,Will you let Professor Min operate on Gong Hyeong-u?,,631
1881.254,1883.844,That's not right. We can't do that to a patient.,,632
1885.174,1886.974,You should talk to the hospital director.,,633
1887.051,1888.261,Tell him you'll do it.,,634
1888.887,1889.927,Isn't that in two days?,5.0,635
1890.805,1894.095,I have skull base tumor surgery tomorrow afternoon.,5.0,636
1894.183,1895.313,It won't have ended by then.,5.0,637
1895.393,1896.943,I just don't have time for it.,5.0,638
1897.437,1900.397,You can ask the anesthesiologist to buy you some time.,,639
1900.481,1902.481,I'll set up everything.,,640
1902.567,1904.437,"I don't know. Gosh, I'm getting a headache.",5.0,641

1912.327,1914.157,-Professor Chae. -Stop it.,,646
1914.245,1916.075,That's enough whining.,2.0,647
1925.506,1928.296,-What did I just say? -You saw Professor Jang with his junior.,5.0,648
1932.221,1934.431,"-You knew it, didn't you? -It was a coincidence.",5.0,649
1935.141,1938.441,-Hey. -It's a day or two before he came clean.,2.0,650

1949.697,1951.617,Yes. I would tell you right away.,5.0,657
1951.699,1954.869,I would tell you your girlfriend was cheating on you the second I saw it.,5.0,658
1956.496,1958.746,-What is it? -It's time for your outpatients.,,659
1959.332,1961.922,-I don't have outpatients today. -I was talking to Professor Chae.,2.0,660
1962.627,1963.667,Right.,5.0,661
1965.755,1966.665,We're not done.,5.0,662
1971.552,1975.602,Dr. Ahn Chi-hong from NS was waiting by the door.,,663
1975.682,1976.642,Okay.,,664
1978.142,1980.942,Good. This is the best thing you've done this year.,,665
1996.119,1998.659,It's highly likely that he's having hemorrhagic shock.,5.0,666
1999.205,2001.035,"Then, what should we do?",,667
2001.29,2002.58,His pulse is weak.,5.0,668
2002.667,2004.957,We believe he may have a thoracic and brain injury.,5.0,669
2005.044,2006.844,We took him up for CT.,5.0,670
2007.171,2009.341,But we're not sure if he will last.,5.0,671
2009.924,2011.594,There's a slim chance we can save him.,5.0,672
2012.385,2013.795,There's no hope for him.,5.0,673
2015.888,2019.728,"Doctor, please save Ju-hwan.",,674

2083.414,2085.794,-Three years. -Is that how you talk to guardians?,5.0,690
2086.501,2088.421,He could've lived if she did CPR?,1.0,691
2088.711,2090.091,How could you say that?,1.0,692
2090.171,2093.671,Did you think about how guilty she would feel for the rest of her life?,1.0,693
2094.258,2096.968,And how can you be certain if he has no hope or a slim chance?,1.0,694
2098.471,2100.311,I've observed him since he got here.,5.0,695
2100.389,2101.389,I only told her the facts,5.0,696
2101.474,2103.484,after reading his chart and observing his condition.,5.0,697
2105.061,2107.811,But what I told her is true.,5.0,698
2108.94,2110.98,He indeed has a slim chance.,5.0,699
2111.692,2114.952,I told her the truth because I believed she needed to know her son's condition.,5.0,700
